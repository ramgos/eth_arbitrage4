## List of important goals to expand this project

* Expand list of available dexes
* Add logging

### A bit more distant vision

* Expand list of available "input tokens" (allow swapping from X to Y to X when X isn't WMATIC) Need to update contract + evaluate profit against gas price
* Add support for swapping between dexes with different pricing algorithms (need to calculate derivative shit over)
